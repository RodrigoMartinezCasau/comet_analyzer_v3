Comet Analyzer

Comet Analyzer is a modular C program designed to identify chemical elements in a comet’s emission spectrum.  
It loads observed peaks, compares them against a database of known atomic wavelengths, and outputs detected matches, wavelength differences, and confidence probabilities.

This project demonstrates structured programming, modular design, file parsing, search algorithms, and memory-safe dynamic allocation.
